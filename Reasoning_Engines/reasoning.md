# Reasoning engine and the world map
*Where Artificial Intelligence becomes Artificial Wisdom*

Based on an epistemological theory on the fundamental objective of language itself,
 the idea of incorporating an ever-growing reasoning engine arised.
After much research on them, I decided to use TypeDB for Odin for esy of use and
 due to the relentless effort that Vaticle puts to its development.
 
### Why? Ain't the LLM intelligent already?
Language is a tool to encode and share "human experience".
We generate, grow and update our personal Reality Map, that is, whatever we think the present state of affairs of everything, currently is.
Language is in effect the way in which we share this model, effectively making us capable of making the unknown be known without first hand experience.
In essence a language model is a model of language,  and language is a model of how we percive the world. In other words, a model of a model of human interpretation.

A reasoning engine is a way to encode the objects, relationships, and rules of the world in a way that you can use it to calculate possibility and truth value, that is reason.

The idea came from my work as a coach.
Wen I coach, part if not most of my job is to help my clients to challenge, expand, and interconnect their Reality Map.
As I tell them, Your beliefs are the limits of your life.

The system will recreate the map of the user and will use this to check and calculate things like limiting, contradicting, and false beliefs, will be able to oint with detail logical fallacies wrong reasoning and help us expand our confort zone.
